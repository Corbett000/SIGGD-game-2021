# SIGGD-game-2021
The repository for The Purdue Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group for Game Design's 2021 video game project.

This project will be a Top Down Boss-Battle Stealth Game which SIGGD will work on during the 2021-2022 school year.

General use:
  1) Have members of your team each create branches for all new changes after this to avoid overwriting anyone's work
  2) Once something on a branch is "done" pull the latest branches from master into your own branch
  3) Check that your branch still works with the newest master changes
  4) Create a pull request from your branch into master
  5) These pull requests will be checked by one of the project leads and merged if able, if not, marge master into your own branch again and fix any conflicts
